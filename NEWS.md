# rvec 0.0.3

- Split help for distributions into multiple files
- added 'by' argument to collapse_to_rvec
- added summary method

# rvec 0.0.2

## Bug fix

- Added `drop = FALSE` argument to calls to `matrixStats::rowQuantiles()`

# rvec 0.0.1

## Minor feature added

- Added method for `is.numeric()`. (Can't add methods for 
`is.character()`, `is.double()`, `is.integer()`, `is.logical()`, 
since these are non-generic primitives.
