    c(person(given = "John",
             family = "Bryant",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: Random vectors, called rvecs. An rvec holds
    multiple draws, but tries to behave like a standard
    R vector, including working well in data frames. Rvecs are
    useful for working with output from a simulation or
    a Bayesian analysis.
